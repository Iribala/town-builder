## Architecture

Town Builder is a real-time multiplayer 3D town builder. Three layers communicate:

- **Backend** – Kukicha (transpiled to Go, `net/http.ServeMux` + Go 1.22 method patterns) following a strict `Routes → Services → Storage` layering. Routes handle HTTP; services hold all business logic; `internal/storage/` abstracts Redis (primary) with an in-memory map fallback when Redis is unavailable. Sources live in `*.kuki` files; brewed `.go` files are committed alongside so `go test` / `go build` work without a build step.
- **Frontend** – Vanilla JavaScript + Three.js (no framework). `static/js/scene.js` is the central orchestrator; `static/js/ui.js` handles DOM events; `static/js/network.js` manages SSE reconnection.
- **Physics WASM** – `physics_wasm.kuki` brews to `physics_wasm.go` and compiles to `static/wasm/physics_greentea.wasm`. Exposes a spatial-grid collision system and car physics as global JS functions (`wasmUpdateSpatialGrid`, `wasmCheckCollision`, `wasmBatchCheckCollisions`, `wasmUpdateCarPhysics`, etc.). WASM loading is non-critical; the app degrades gracefully if it fails.

**Multiplayer flow:** client POST → backend saves to Redis → publishes to Redis Pub/Sub channel `town_events` → SSE endpoint (`GET /events`) fans out to connected clients.

## Key Conventions

### Layout data normalization
Town data arrives in two shapes (map-of-categories or list-of-objects). Always pass it through `internal/normalization.NormalizeLayoutData()` before use. The canonical category list lives in `internal/normalization.Categories`.

### Adding a new API endpoint
1. Define request/response types in `internal/models/schemas.kuki`.
2. Implement logic in a new `internal/services/<name>/<name>.kuki`.
3. Create route handler in `internal/routes/<name>/<name>.kuki`.
4. Register the route in `internal/routes/router/router.kuki`.

After editing any `.kuki` file, brew the `.go` next to it (see `docs/plans/kukicha-port.md` "Build pipeline" section).

### Configuration
`internal/config/config.kuki` exposes settings loaded from `.env`. Key variables:
- `DISABLE_JWT_AUTH=true` – bypass auth in development/tests.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` – comma-separated CORS origins; defaults to localhost in development if empty.
- `ROOT_PATH` – reverse-proxy path prefix for template URL generation.

### Security utilities
Use `internal/utils/security/` for any new file path operations (path-traversal prevention) or outbound HTTP calls (SSRF prevention). Allowed external domains are controlled by `settings.AllowedApiDomains`.

### Testing
- Tests live next to their subject as `<name>_test.kuki` (brewed to `<name>_test.go`); run with `go test ./internal/...`.
- `config.SetForTest(s)` injects settings; `storage.SetClient(empty)` + `storage.ResetMemory()` give a clean in-memory store.
- `httptest.NewServer` against `router.NewMux()` is the standard pattern for route integration tests.
- Mock external Django API calls with `httptest.NewServer` returning canned JSON.

### Commit messages
Follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.

### WASM output file
The physics module outputs to `static/wasm/physics_greentea.wasm` (not `physics.wasm`).

## Writing Kukicha

Detailed Kukicha reference (syntax, stdlib, compiler-enforced security checks, gotchas) lives in the `kukicha` skill at `.claude/skills/kukicha/SKILL.md`. It is auto-loaded when you edit `.kuki` files or use kukicha tooling.

`kukicha init` recreates this section if regenerated — leave the skill as the source of truth and replace the regenerated block with this pointer if it returns.
